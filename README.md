# Password Complexity Checker

This repository contains a simple Python script that checks the complexity of a password based on certain criteria. It helps determine the strength of a password by assessing its length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the `password_complexity.py` file.

2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

3. Run the script by executing the following command in the terminal or command prompt:

4. Enter a password when prompted.

5. The script will evaluate the complexity of the entered password and display the corresponding message.

## Customization

You can modify or expand the code according to your specific requirements. The `check_password_complexity` function in the `password_complexity.py` file contains the logic for determining the complexity based on criteria such as length, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. You can adjust these criteria or add new ones as needed.

The `get_password_complexity_message` function provides user-friendly messages based on the complexity level. You can customize these messages to suit your preferences or localization.
